# Minecraft Resources

For legal and ethical reasons, I must make it clear I am not the original author of materials stored in `vanilla/`.

These assets belong to Microsoft/Mojang and are used in the 1.18.2 version of Minecraft Java Edition.

***

The intended use of these assets:

- References for JSON schemas when developing data packs, resources for third party game mods.
- References for image assets when developing resource packs, assets for third party game mods.
- Previews of textures used for my other projects, such as https://github.com/ChrisOfNormandy/conloot-gui.

This repository does not include game code, such as Java classes or binaries.
